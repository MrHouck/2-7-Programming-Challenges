# Challenge #4 - Markov Chain Sentence Generator

Thanks to [this project](https://github.com/CrowdTruth/Short-Text-Corpus-For-Humor-Detection/blob/master/datasets/reuters_headlines.pickle) for the dataset of headlines.

For this project I decided to make a markov chain sentence generator that generates fake headlines, just to see if it comes up with anything funny

Here's what 10 generations starting from the word "The" gave me:
1. The fatal accidents in at mali customs post sanctions  mainstream scandinavia warily eyes shifting some
2. The migration  on mexico s report  after bomb supply lines  on damascus expects
3. The u s faulty ignition switch plaintiff retains key to sever child  over fed is
