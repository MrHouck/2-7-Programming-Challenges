# 2<sup>7</sup> Programming Challenges

### Quick Note:
__This is an edited version of the [original list](assets/programmingchallenges.png). I have removed challenges that have no interest to me (mostly booru/chan board stuff) as well as challenges that require me to install additional software, require a different OS, or involve real life components (computer boards, VR headset, etc.).__
